			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>MediaCore uses a popularity ranking algorithm similar to Reddit's.</li>
				<li>The popularity of a media item is described by: log_x(media.likes) + media.age/y</li>
				<li>Where: <ul>
					<li>x (the base of the logarithm) is the "Popularity Decay Exponent"</li>
					<li>y is the "Popularity Decay Lifetime"</li>
					<li>media.age is the number of hours between January 1, 2000, and the time the media item was published</li>
					<li>media.likes is the number of likes the media item has received</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>Essentially, in this algorithm, a media item (A) that is y hours older than media item (B), will need x times as many votes as (B) to rank at the same level.</li>
				<li>Lower traffic websites will want a higher y value, or a lower x value, or both.</li>
			</ul>
