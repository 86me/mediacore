Until Mediaplex reaches a stable state, all work is being done in 
the "devel" branch. To get your local copy up to date with development:

  1. Create and switch to a new local branch for your work:
      $ git checkout -b devel

  2. Bring it up to date with all the changes in the remote devel branch:
      $ git merge origin/devel
